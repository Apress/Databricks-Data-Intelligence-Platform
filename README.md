## Chatbot - Diabetes complication classification based on patient medical history
Databricks Data Intelligence Platform provides the intelligence to power the gen AI application. It is built on top of the Lakehouse architecture, so it has a strong foundation of supporting any size of workload and complex data transformation. In this chapter, we will look at the ability to create an application from ideation to creation, all within Databricks. While other platforms may come with similar tools in their ecosystem, Databricksâ€™ tight integration allows us to stay on the same platform and collaborate closely with the team.
